## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheNightmareX/pennfoster-helper
npm i
npm run dev:client
```

As the initial HTML generated by Angular cannot pass the enforced Content Security Policy, we have to run a script to adjust the `index.html` after each build in a new terminal.

```sh
npm run script:csp
```
